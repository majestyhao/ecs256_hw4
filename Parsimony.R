# Explore a new approach for Model selection probelm: select predictor

# protection against overfitting; 
# 2. starting with the full model (use all avail preodicator)ï¼Œ del one 
# at a time as long as the PAC doesn't deteriorate much (how to justify it?)
# 3. handle even n is large

  # y: The vector of response values in the data.
  # x: The matrix of predictor values.
  # k: The "almost" measure, discussed above.
  # predacc: The PAC function, with arguments y and x.
  # crit: Either "max" or "min", depending on whether good values of the PAC are large or small.
  # printdel: If TRUE, gives a "progress report" as the computation proceeds. Each time a predictor is deleted, the new value of the PAC is printed out, along with the name of the variable.
